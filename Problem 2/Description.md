I am simply comparing all the files in a given directory and the files in the subdirectories in that directory, file by file.
That are a lot of combinations but back then I wasn't familiar with Maps and Sets. 
A better solution now I believe it will be if we put the content of the file as a KEY to a HashMap and when we find a file which content already exists as a key => those file are equal.
