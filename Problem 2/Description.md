# I am simply comparing all the files in a given directory and the subdirectories in that directory. Back then I wasn't familiar with Maps and Sets. 
A better solution I belieave will be if we put the content of the file as a KEY to a HashMap and when we find a file which content exists as a key, those file are equal.
